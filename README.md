# Elements

A WinForms app written in C# which lets you import a .txt file with a list of elements from the atomic table, perform CRUD operations, and saves output to a .json file using the json.NET framework by Newtonsoft.

Built for one of the timed practical exams for Programming II (COMP-123) at Centennial College.

Here's how it looks:
